### Dataset

This data was pulled from [eSportsEarning.com](https://www.esportsearnings.com/) and has info for players and teams in different tournements.

### Visualizations

* Showing price per tournement grouped by genre
* Split out prize per player for games
* Show where most tournements happen

### Possible Hypothesis

* First-Person Shooters pay more per player
* It makes more sense for someone to compete in games that do not have teams, or have small teams

### To-do's:

* Maybe scrape more from site for comparasins
