# Capstone 1 - Proposals

## [eSports Winnings](https://www.kaggle.com/jackdaoud/esports-earnings-for-players-teams-by-game)

### Dataset

This data was pulled from [eSportsEarning.com](https://www.esportsearnings.com/) and has info for players and teams in different tournements.

### Visualizations

* Showing price per tournement grouped by genre

![Genre Players](data/barh_players_prize_per_genere.png)

* Split out prize per player for games by genre

![Prize per player](data/avg_prize_per_team_by_genre.png)


### Possible Hypothesis

* First-Person Shooters pay more per player
* It makes more sense for someone to compete in games that do not have teams, or have small teams

### To-do's:

* Maybe scrape more from site for comparasons
